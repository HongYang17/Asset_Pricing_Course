# Asset Pricing – MSc Quantitative Finance Coursework

This repository contains a complete set of Jupyter notebooks exploring key concepts in asset pricing, developed as part of the MSc in Quantitative Finance at SMU. Each notebook covers theory, empirical implementation, and coding exercises using real and simulated data.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Efficient Frontier & Portfolio Theory
- Constructed efficient frontiers using mean-variance optimization on synthetic and historical return data
- Computed global minimum variance and tangency portfolios with/without a risk-free asset
- Visualized capital allocation lines and optimal weights under risk aversion preferences

### 2. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) & Linear Factor Models
- Estimated CAPM betas and alphas via OLS regression
- Evaluated factor pricing errors using the GRS test and security market lines
- Extended to Fama-French 3-factor and 5-factor models; analyzed explanatory power and residual variance

### 3. Performance Measurement
- Computed Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Jensen’s alpha, and information ratio across portfolios
- Performed backtesting on risk-adjusted return metrics using rolling windows
- Visualized cumulative return and performance comparisons vs. benchmarks

### 4. Stochastic Discount Factors (SDF)
- Derived pricing equations using the SDF approach under complete markets
- Implemented Hansen-Jagannathan bounds and evaluated pricing kernel admissibility
- Simulated SDFs for representative agents using marginal utility and Euler equations

### 5. State Pricing & Arrow-Debreu Securities
- Solved for state prices using matrix inversion and linear systems
- Recovered Arrow-Debreu prices from market payoffs under absence of arbitrage
- Analyzed state-contingent claims and pricing kernel decomposition

### 6. Behavioral Finance Insights
- Simulated investor behavior under prospect theory and loss aversion
- Modeled framing effects and probability weighting on portfolio choice
- Compared expected utility and cumulative prospect theory pricing kernels

##  Technical Stack
- Python: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `cvxpy`
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive visualization and reproducibility
- All code organized by topic and annotated with mathematical explanations

## Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of theoretical asset pricing models and their empirical tests
- Strong coding ability in quantitative modeling, portfolio optimization, and econometrics
- Full pipeline from theoretical formulation to numerical implementation and analysis
